## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Week 3 of the AI/ML Development Track. This week, you'll work on customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques and develop a content-based recommendation system for products. This will involve clustering methods and similarity measures to recommend products effectively.

## 2. Why Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation?

Customer segmentation helps in identifying distinct groups within a customer base, allowing for targeted marketing and personalized experiences. Product recommendation engines enhance user experience by suggesting relevant products, increasing engagement and sales.

## 3. Workflow Overview

1. Find a customer transaction dataset
2. Implement unsupervised learning techniques for customer segmentation:
   - K-means clustering using Scikit-learn
   - DBSCAN for density-based clustering
3. [Optional] Create a content-based recommendation system:
   - TF-IDF vectorization for product descriptions (Scikit-learn)
   - Cosine similarity for item-item similarity

## 4. Detailed Task Breakdown

### 4.1. Find a customer transaction dataset

- Here are some good customer transaction datasets to use for clustering:
  - [Ecommerce Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data/data)
  - [Customer Personality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis/data)

### 4.2. Implement Unsupervised Learning Techniques for Customer Segmentation

- Here are some good Kaggle notebook demos for the above 2 datasets to start with:
  - [Fabien Daniel - Customer Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fabiendaniel/customer-segmentation)
  - [Karnika Kapoor - Customer Segmentation and Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/code/karnikakapoor/customer-segmentation-clustering)

- **K-means Clustering**
  - Use Scikit-learn to implement K-means clustering.
  - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method or silhouette score.
  - [Guide to K-means Clustering](https://realpython.com/k-means-clustering-python/)
  - [K-means Clustering Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)
  
- **DBSCAN**
  - Apply DBSCAN for density-based clustering.
  - Adjust parameters like epsilon and minimum samples to achieve meaningful clusters.
  - [Guide to DBSCAN Clustering (At the bottom)](https://nzlul.medium.com/clustering-method-using-k-means-hierarchical-and-dbscan-using-python-5ca5721bbfc3)
  - [DBSCAN Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html)

### 4.3. Optional: Create a Content-Based Recommendation System

- Here are some good customer transaction datasets to use for clustering:
- [Customer Recommendation (Step 12) (This is a basic recommendation system based on clusters)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/farzadnekouei/customer-segmentation-recommendation-system#Step-12-%7C-Recommendation-System)
- [Recommendations using Association Rules](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pierrelouisdanieau/recommender-system-associations-rules)

Here are some ideas you could use to make even more personalized suggestions to users based on their previous purchases:

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**
  - Use TF-IDF to convert product descriptions into numerical vectors.
  - [TF-IDF Vectorizer Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html)

- **Cosine Similarity**
  - Calculate cosine similarity between products to find similar items.
  - [Cosine Similarity Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html)

## 5. Deliverables

- Jupyter notebook with the implementation of customer segmentation and product recommendation pipeline.
- A concise Markdown report discussing your approach, challenges, and results.
- [Optional] Python script for the real-time recommendation API.

## 6. Submission Guidelines

- Submit your Jupyter notebook as a `.ipynb` file.
- Submit your report as a `.md` file.
- [Optional] Submit your API script as a `.py` file.
