# DevClub Summer of Code 2024: Backend Development Track

### Why learn this?
Backend development encompasses the creation and maintenance of the server-side components that power web applications. It involves designing, developing, and managing the logic, databases, and infrastructure required to handle data processing, user authentication, business logic, and integrations. Backend developers work with programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or Node.js to build robust APIs, implement server-side functionalities, and ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend. They focus on performance, security, and scalability, enabling the seamless functioning of web applications and delivering a reliable and efficient user experience.

### What we'll be building?
Hola People...!!! This time,
We will be building a Point of Sales System from scratch. For the website, we will have a frontend and a backend. The frontend will be built using React and the backend will be built using Flask (Python) as the first language. Though, those interested may also build this using JavaScript (For which we will be providing support alongwith). Also, we will be using PostGreSQL for Database...

## Point of Sales (PoS) System

The project aims to develop a sophisticated Point of Sales (PoS) system to streamline inventory management and sales processes. The system includes features for user authentication, customer management, inventory management, sales tracking, file uploading, invoice generation, and state management.

## Why Use Flask for PoS Development?

- *Scalability and Flexibility:* Flask provides the flexibility to scale the application as needed, making it ideal for building a PoS system that may evolve over time.
- *Microframework Approach:* Flaskâ€™s lightweight nature allows for minimal setup, giving developers control over which components to include, thus ensuring a streamlined and efficient development process.
- *Strong Community Support:* The extensive documentation and active community support available for Flask help address development issues and leverage best practices.

*Project Tasks (First Half):*
1. *PoS Interface and Transactions:*
    - Develop API endpoints for the PoS interface.
    - Implement the checkout process, including item addition and removal from the cart.
    - Ensure proper validation and error handling for sales transactions.
2. *Invoice Generation:*
    - Use libraries like ReportLab or WeasyPrint to generate PDF invoices.
    - Implement functionality to email invoices to customers.
3. *Transaction History:*
    - Develop endpoints to store and retrieve transaction history.
    - Implement secure access to transaction history data.
    - Ensure data integrity and secure storage practices for transaction data.

*Concepts (Second Half):*
- Deployment strategies for Flask applications.
- Using Docker to containerize the application.

*Project Tasks (Second Half):*
1. *Containerization:*
    - Containerize the Flask application using Docker.
    - Write a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for the application.

### Week 5: Final Deployment

*Concepts:*
- Setting up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Deploying to a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure).

*Project Tasks:*
1. *CI/CD Pipeline:*
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
    - Automate the deployment process.
2. *Cloud Deployment:*
    - Deploy the application to a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
    - Configure environment variables and secrets management.
3. *Production-Readiness:*
    - Ensure the application is production-ready with proper security configurations.
    - Optimize for scalability and performance.
4. *Monitoring and Logging:*
    - Set up monitoring and logging for the deployed application to ensure it runs smoothly in production.
