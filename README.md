# DevClub Summer of Code 2024

Fee fi fo fum, watch out everyone, HERE I COME! DevClub, IIT Delhi welcomes you to the 2nd edition of DevClub Summer of Code. DSoC is a 5-week long hackathon helping students learn development in the fields of **App**, **Backend**, **Frontend**, and **Machine Learning**. These fields are further referred to as tracks.

For each track, there is a **5-week long project** on a common theme divided into weekly guided assignments with increasing difficulty, where we will be providing resources and tasks so that you can learn, build, and showcase!

DevClub will also be giving attracting **rewards** to those people who participate enthusiastically, and will also **recruit members** for the upcoming tenure.

## The Tracks

### [App Development](app)
- [ ] **[Week 1](app/week-1)** :
Setting up flutter sdk and vscode,
creating a flutter project,learning basic widgets,routing,snackbars and finally replicating figma design.

### [Backend Development](backend)
- [ ] **[Week 1](backend/week-1)** : Setting up the dev environment, initialise a Flask project, connect it to PostgreSQL, and create database models for inventory items and customers.

### [Frontend Development](frontend)
- [ ] **[Week 1](frontend/week-1)** : Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing Login and Sign-Up page. Use provided Figma designs and ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes.

### [Machine Learning](machine-learning)
- [ ] **[Week 1](machine-learning/week-1)** : Learn how to build a full ML model to detect fraudulant transactions for our POS system. Start off with standard ML libraries like sklearn, numpy and pandas. 

## How to Participate
- First of all, [make a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you haven't already!
- [Fork](https://github.com/devclub-iitd/summer-of-code-2024/fork) this repository. This will give you a copy of this repository where you can do changes as you like. Make sure to [sync](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) latest changes whenever your fork falls behind ours. Later, you should install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), setup [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent), and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork on your local machine. You can also refer to [this video](https://youtu.be/YDniPA01pJc?t=2820) by DevClub for learning git.
- Edit [author.json](author.json) to include your details so that we can identify you. Feel free to include other details like `mobile_number`, `email_id`, etc.
- Check out each [track](#the-tracks) from their respective folder, and explore about them. You can try out multiple tracks too!
- Every week, we will share **resources** to learn concepts for each track step-by-step, along with small **assignments** which will add up to the project.
- We will also be having regular online lectures or discussion sessions to help you learn better.
- **Upload** your submissions on your respective forks for each week to the track folder. (NO NEED to create pull request to the main repository for merging your changes).
- Join out **[WhatsApp Community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/EOoXP2jEWAj2V8eJlQqf4H)** for any queries, discussions, and to stay up-to-date.

## Aim
We aim to help students get started with learning coding and software development. The concepts for each [track](#the-tracks) are divided into **weeks** pedagogically so you can learn step-by-step.

No matter if you're a beginner or an expert, at each stage, you will be learning something new, and building something **useful** in real world. You will also be equipped with the skills and tools which would meet **most tech requirements**, and the final projects in each track will be good enough to be put in your **portfolio or CV**.

We are keeping the repository open to **everyone from around the world**, so everyone can use it to learn and share their ideas in the forks.

## Theme and Project
The newly inaugurated retail store at SDA Market, Hauz Khas, is seeking to implement a sophisticated Point of Sales (PoS) system to streamline its inventory management and sales processes. With over 200 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), the store currently faces challenges in managing inventory and maintaining accurate sales records, leading to significant financial losses. This project aims to develop an integrated PoS system that addresses these challenges by providing a centralized solution for inventory control, customer management, sales tracking, and predictive analytics.

### What is a PoS System
To understand a POS system, it's crucial to grasp the concept of a Point of Sale (POS). A Point of Sale refers to the specific physical or virtual location where a transaction takes place, typically involving the exchange of goods or services for payment. In a physical store, this could be a checkout counter equipped with a cash register and barcode scanner. Online, it represents the virtual platform where customers complete purchases. A POS system encompasses both hardware and software components that streamline these transactions, recording sales data, managing inventory, and often integrating with other business operations like customer relationship management (CRM) and accounting. This technology ensures accuracy, efficiency, and enhanced customer service in retail environments.

### What you will be building
There are basically 4 requirements of the system you will be building:
- Web User Interfaces for Cashier and Admin to record sales and manage inventory and customer data, and a dashboard to view analytics of sales.
- A Mobile App through which the process of billing can be made easily accessible to the cashier by adding advanced features like item barcode scanning, etc.
- A common backend server for the web app and mobile app helping them execute the functionalities. It must be highly secure and role based authentication must be set, i.e. can be accessed by only who is authorised.
- Machine Learning models which intake the sales data and detect fraud, while providing valuable insights to the store managers regarding sales trends, inventory and ordering, etc. AI models which can interact with the customer for customer service, and which can apply complex reasoning to knowledgebase and web data to extract valuable insights.

## Rewards
- For students from IIT Delhi
    - From each track, we will be recruiting **Executive Members** for the DevClub team in the upcoming tenure.
    - **Certificates** and **ECAs** will be provided to students who perform exceptionally well.
- We will also be sharing **opportunities** relevant to the tools we have covered here, and your submissions can serve as a proof of your skill.
- We will be showcasing the **best projects** on our Social Media handles.
